```javascript
python -m pytest --alluredir full_path_to_report_folder
```
1. At the end you will get test run results. It will contain some brief information about test results
```javascript

```
But to get more representative results we are going to generate Allure report.

# HOW TO GENERATE ALLURE REPORT:
We are using Allure Framework to get nice and detailed representation of the results.

You need to execute following line in a Command Prompt:
```javascript
allure serve full_path_to_report_folder
```
Generated Allure report will be shown in your browser.

Here is the one that was generated for this project: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alderven/cafe/master/allure-report/index.html

You can find a lot of helpful information in the Allure report such as:

* Overall test run status:
