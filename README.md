1. Install Allure Framework. See detailed instruction: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/latest/

# HOW TO RUN TESTS:
1. Launch Command Prompt (cmd.exe) in the project folder
1. Execute following line in Command Prompt:
```javascript
python -m pytest --alluredir full_path_to_report_folder
```
1. At the end you will get test run results. It will contain some brief information about test results
```javascript
==================== 1 failed, 5 passed in 92.04 seconds =====================
```
But to get more representative results we are going to generate Allure report.

# HOW TO GENERATE ALLURE REPORT:
We are using Allure Framework to get nice and detailed representation of the results.

You need to execute following line in a Command Prompt:
```javascript
allure serve full_path_to_report_folder
```
Generated Allure report will be shown in your browser.

Here is the one that was generated for this project: https://cdn.rawgit.com/alderven/cafe/master/allure-report/index.html

You can find a lot of helpful information in the Allure report such as:

* Overall test run status:
![Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alderven/cafe/master/imgs/Status.png)
* Features which were tested (here you can see that all blocking functionality is fine and one critical functionality was broken):
![Severity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alderven/cafe/master/imgs/Severity.png)
* Features which were tested:

# TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
Following technologies were used:
* Python: scripting language for writing tests
* Pytest: test framework for Python for better tests organization
* Selenium WebDriver: allows to interact with the web browser
* Allure Framework: allows to generate web page with the nice representation of test results
